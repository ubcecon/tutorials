## Setting up AWS
General sign-up instructions:
1. Sign up for Free Tier https://aws.amazon.com/free  which gives you credits for cheap instances
   - This may require a credit card.
2. Sign up for https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/ in order to get free $100 cloud credits and other materials
   - Click on Join AWS Educate and choose if a student or eductor
    - Use an email that is given to you by the institution you choose in the form. Do not use an alumni email (something like someone@alumni.ubc.ca) because in the verification process they do not think you are not a student anymore and may need to provide a copy of your student id.  Note that this step doesnt require a credit card information
